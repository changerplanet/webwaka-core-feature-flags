✅ OFFICIAL AUTHORIZATION — PHASE 3F-3

WebWaka Modular Rebuild

Phase: 3F-3
Core: Feature Flags & Experiments
Repository: webwaka-core-feature-flags
Status: AUTHORIZED TO IMPLEMENT

⸻

AUTHORIZATION STATEMENT

You are hereby explicitly authorized to proceed with:

Phase 3F-3 — Core Feature Flags & Experiments Implementation

This authorization is granted based on:
	•	Approved Phase 3F-1 OSS Evaluation
	•	Approved Phase 3F-2 Formal Specification (LOCKED)
	•	Alignment with the WebWaka Ecosystem Constitution v1.3.1 (Ratified)

⸻

IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE (STRICT)

You MUST implement exactly and only what is defined in Phase 3F-2 Specification, including:

✅ Core Deliverables
	•	Pure, deterministic feature flag evaluation engine
	•	Deterministic experiment assignment engine
	•	SHA-256–based hashing and bucketing
	•	Snapshot generation, verification, and evaluation
	•	Strict tenant isolation
	•	Time-bound rule enforcement
	•	Precedence hierarchy enforcement
	•	Capability registration in module.manifest.json

✅ Required APIs
	•	checkFeature()
	•	assignExperimentVariant()
	•	generateFeatureSnapshot()
	•	verifySnapshot()
	•	evaluateFromSnapshot()

✅ Required Guarantees
	•	Determinism (same input → same output, proven via tests)
	•	Offline-safe evaluation via snapshots
	•	No cross-tenant leakage (hard error if attempted)
	•	≥80% test coverage
	•	Explicit Hard Stop proof test

⸻

🚫 EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN

You MUST NOT:
	•	Add UI or dashboards
	•	Add persistence or databases
	•	Add analytics, tracking, or telemetry
	•	Call external services or SDKs
	•	Implement pricing, incentives, or entitlements logic
	•	Introduce feature toggles outside the spec
	•	Drift from the locked precedence hierarchy

⸻

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
	•	Language: TypeScript only
	•	Architecture: Headless library
	•	Side Effects: NONE
	•	I/O: NONE
	•	Hashing: SHA-256 only
	•	Environment: Library-safe (no Node globals required at runtime)

⸻

HARD STOP CONDITION (MANDATORY)

You MUST include a test that proves:

A Suite can evaluate a feature flag or experiment online or offline, for a given subject and tenant, and receive a deterministic, explainable, verifiable result, respecting precedence, time bounds, and tenant isolation.

If this is not proven in tests, the phase is NOT COMPLETE.

⸻

DELIVERABLE AT COMPLETION

Upon completion, submit a Phase 3F-3 Completion Report containing:
	1.	Summary of implemented APIs
	2.	Invariants enforced
	3.	Capability list
	4.	Test coverage metrics
	5.	Hard Stop proof reference (test name + description)
	6.	Final commit SHA

Then:

⛔ STOP
⛔ Do NOT proceed to any other phase
⛔ Await explicit authorization
